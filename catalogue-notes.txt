We want to display the list of products when the user clicks Catalogue

We connect the webpage link to the hyperlink "GET /api/catalog"

1. Create a layer that deals with querying the database
      in db folder
        dbQuery.js
          creates a connection to the database server
          submits sql queries and gets results (through the callback mechanism)
        productDAO.js
            implements the queries related to products we need in our appplication

2. Create a higher-level module that searches for the products using different criteria
      in services folder 
        productServices.js

3. Create a control layer responsible for handling the HTTPS request
      in controllers folder
        productController.js

4. Create a routes module for which our server provides a responsible
      in routes folder  
        apis.js
